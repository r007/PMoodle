External tools differ from URL resources in a few ways:
* **Context aware** - External tools have access to information about the user who launched the tool, such as
        insitution, course, name, and other information.
* **Deep integration** - External tools support reading, updating, and deleting grades associated with the activity instance. More integration points
        are planned for future releases.
