The Maintenance Fee for renewal shall be equal to the Maintenance Fee for the immediate preceding annual term plus an increase by a percentage not to exceed the Consumer Price Index (CPI), as published by the U.S. Department of Labor.  In addition, Maintenance shall be discontinued for any and all subsequent Support and Maintenance Terms for which You fail to pay Foxit Corporation the invoice within ten (10) days after the prior Maintenance expiration date.
