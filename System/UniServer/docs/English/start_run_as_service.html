<h2>UniController Menu</h2>

<p>When using this menu, you install the servers as services; it adds data to your operating system’s registry. The dvantages of running as a service, when you restart your PC, servers’ will automatically re-start. You can install and run services from a USB memory stick however, you must remember to stop and uninstall services before removing your USB stick.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> For Vista and Win7, admin privileges are required. To run as administrator, right click on <b>Start_as_service.exe</b> and click Properties and then choose run as administrator.</p>

<h2>Interlinked server control</h2>

<p>The server control menus are interlinked; this prevents you running both menus at the same time. If you have a single server Apache or MySQL running as a service and close the “run as a service” menu and then open the “run as a program menu”, you will find its corresponding server buttons are greyed out.</p>

<p>Similarly the reverse is true. A single server Apache or MySQL running as a program will have its corresponding server buttons greyed out in the “run as a service menu”</p>

<p>This interlinking applies when running multi-servers; the first server started (Apache or MySQL) will have its corresponding buttons greyed out in all other server menus. This means you can have a single instance of the MySQL server running and have several different Apache servers running, all accessing the one MySQL server.</p>
